Your openness and trust have allowed me to take on new challenges with confidence, and your support—both professionally and personally—has made a real difference. I truly appreciate the way you foster collaboration, recognize efforts, and create a space where we can do our best work while feeling a sense of belonging.

Thank you for everything you do, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow under your leadership.
